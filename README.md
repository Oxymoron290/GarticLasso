# Gartic Phone Lasso

My friend loves to play Gartic Phone. https://garticphone.com/  A drawing game based on the game of telephone played in a browser. Gartic Phone is a free, browser-based online multiplayer party game that mashes up the "telephone" game with Pictionary. Players take turns writing bizarre prompts and drawing them, resulting in hilarious misinterpretations as the prompt evolves.

My friend loves to play this game with the chrome Extension "Artist Tools for Gartic Phone" found here - https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/artist-tools-for-gartic-p/jimdddbdlngpncjdbfggmjieegcnjcbd?pli=1

However this extension does not have a lasso fill tool. We are going to change that. lets create our own extension that works with gartic phone and the artists tools to create lasso tool to work with it.

In addition, having a tapered brush tool also would be benefitial
